# Ministry of Testing Athens: How Storybook can change the way you are testing

This is the repository for the presentation that I did for Ministry of Testing in Athens with title "How Storybook can change the way you are testing"

You can also find the presentation here (just the presentation) http://www.web-and-development.com/storybook-presentation/ and the full presentation of Ministry of Testing #2 (in Greek) here: https://youtu.be/EsnxyIFDyco 

For the presentation I used impressJS (https://github.com/impress/impress.js/) and love ♥️
